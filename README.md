#### Basics

- [Tone.js API](https://tonejs.github.io/docs/) - documentation
- [Tone.js Wiki](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/wiki) - covers a few things not explained in the API, ex. Time, envelopes 
- [Tone.js Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tonejs) - ask a question here if you can't get it answered in class
- [PDM Online Textbook](https://pdm.lsupathways.org/) - in development for highschool class but covers all necessary material

#### Extras

- [Interactive Presets](https://www.guitarland.com/MusicTheoryWithToneJS/Presets-gh-pages/) - use to experiment and find new sounds, do not copy presets from here else you add something unique to them. 
- [Make music with Tone](https://www.guitarland.com/MusicTheoryWithToneJS/TonejsSetup.html) - some tutorials for making more traditional music with Tone
- [tone-rhythm](https://github.com/scraggo/tone-rhythm) - very helpful for making musical phrases with tone
  - [Ex. Maria](https://codesandbox.io/s/qzq0lvpq0w) - play Maria with tone. This requires knowledge of importing from npm with the 'import' keyword. It will not work with a script tag.
- [Algorithmic Music Tutorial](https://junshern.github.io/algorithmic-music-tutorial/) - uses p5 sound but many of the creative ideas are transferable to Tone.js
